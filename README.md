====================
Sonraki Adim iOS App
====================

App description should come here.

Installation
============

SonrakiAdim uses `CocoaPods` for its dependency management. The first thing you should do is to make sure cocoapods (and ruby obviously) works.
Issue the following commands:

    cd SonrakiAdim
    pod update 

This will create the dependencies. From now on you should only use the `SonrakiAdim.xcworkspace` file to open xcode.
